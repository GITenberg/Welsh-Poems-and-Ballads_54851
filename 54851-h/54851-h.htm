9</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap"><span class='red'>I</span></span><span
class="smcap">n</span> a collection of unedited odds and ends
from Borrow&rsquo;s papers bearing upon Wales, and dating from
various periods of his career, there is one insignificant-looking
sheet on whose back some lines are pencilled, beginning
&ldquo;The mountain snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are reproduced in the
text, but deserve notice here because of the evidence they bring
of Borrow&rsquo;s long-continued Welsh obsession and his long
practice as a Welsh translator.&nbsp; Apparently they date from
the time when he was writing &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; since the
other side of the leaf contains a draft in ink of the preface to
that book.&nbsp; Other sheets of blue foolscap in the same
bundle&mdash;folded small for the pocket&mdash;are devoted to
unnumbered chapters of &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet
another scrap, from a much earlier period, is so closely packed
in a microscopic hand that it reminds one at a first glance of
the painfully minute script of the Bront&euml; sisters in their
earliest attempts.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Its matter is only a footnote on the
Celts, Gaels and Cymry, and its substance often reappears in
later pages; but other items both in the early script of a fine
minuscule, and in the later bold, untidy scrawl, serve to carry
on the Welsh account, with references to Pwll Cheres and Goronwy
Owen; and the upshot of them all goes to show that Borrow,
whether he was at Norwich or in London, was not only a stout
Celtophile, but much inclined, early and late, to be a Welsh
idolater.&nbsp; And since the days when the monks of the Priory
at Carmarthen wrote the &ldquo;Black Book&rdquo; in a noble
script, I suppose no copyist ever took more pains than Borrow did
in his early years in transcribing the lines of the Welsh poets,
as the <i>facsimile</i> page given in this volume can tell.</p>
<p>Of the bards and rhymers that he attempted in English, he gave
most care to translating Iolo Goch, four of whose odes open the
present collection.&nbsp; He was tempted to dilate on Iolo, or
&ldquo;Edward the Red,&rdquo; because of that poet&rsquo;s
association with Owen Glendower, a hero in whose exploits he
greatly delighted.&nbsp; The tribute to Owen in &ldquo;Wild
Wales&rdquo; is, or should be, familiar enough to
Borrovians.&nbsp; In <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Chapter XXIII. there is an account of
the landmark which Borrow calls &ldquo;Mont Glyndwr&rdquo;
(though I have never heard it so called in my Welsh wanderings);
while in Chapter LXVI. a description of the other mount at
Sycharth accompanies a translation of the Ode by Iolo, which in a
slightly different earlier text is printed on page eight.&nbsp;
It was after repeating these lines, Borrow tells us, that he
exclaimed, &ldquo;How much more happy, innocent and holy&rdquo;
he was in the days of his boyhood, when he translated the ode,
than &ldquo;at the present time.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, covering
his face with his hands, he wept &ldquo;like a
child.&rdquo;&nbsp; If one re-reads the ode in the light of this
confession, one observes that there is a strong vein of personal
feeling about its lines, and a certain pilgrim strain in its
opening, which would lend themselves readily to Borrow&rsquo;s
mood and the idea, never far away from his thoughts, that in his
wanderings he too was a bard doing &ldquo;Clera.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
need hardly be said that he was wrong in estimating Iolo&rsquo;s
age as &ldquo;upwards of a hundred years,&rdquo; when the ode was
written.&nbsp; In other details of the poem he is more
picturesque than literal; but the English copy of the Welsh
sketch is in essentials near enough <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>for all ordinary purposes; and the
achievement in a boy of eighteen, living at Norwich, far from
Wales, is an extraordinary one.&nbsp; The sort of error that he
fell into was a very natural one to occur; for instance, misled
by his mere dictionary knowledge, he omits the reference to St.
Patrick&rsquo;s clock-tower and the cloisters of
Westminster.&nbsp; The words &ldquo;Kloystr Wesmestr,&rdquo; only
lead in one text to the line, &ldquo;A cloister of
festivities,&rdquo; and in the other to the yet freer
rendering&mdash;&ldquo;muster the merry pleasures
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, the original has no mention of
&ldquo;Usquebaugh,&rdquo; though the Shrewsbury ale is in
order.&nbsp; In medieval Wales, I may add, the bragget mentioned
in these lines was made by mixing ale with mead, and spicing the
mixture&mdash;a decidedly heady liquor, one gathers, when it was
kept awhile.</p>
<p>Iolo Goch, like the greater&mdash;indeed one may say the
greatest Welsh poet, Dafydd ab Gwilym, used a form of verse in
his odes which it is not easy to imitate or follow in English,
keeping all its subtle graces and assonances.&nbsp; It is termed
the &ldquo;Cywydd,&rdquo; which may be taken to signify a verse
in which the words are well knit and finely co-ordinated; or, as
Sir John <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Rhys puts it, &ldquo;elegantly, artistically put
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; The verse, it should be said, is written
in couplets, and the lines are required also to follow a definite
symphonic pattern.&nbsp; Try for example Dafydd&rsquo;s lines,
which Borrow has translated (see page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page59">59</a></span>), upon the
mist.&nbsp; In Welsh they run:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Och! it &rsquo;niwlen felen-fawr<br />
<i>Na throet</i> ti, <i>na therit</i> awr:<br />
Casul <i>yr</i> aw<i>yr</i> ddu-lwyd,<br />
Carth<i>en</i> annib<i>en</i> ia<i>wn</i> wyd,<br />
Mwg ellylldan o annwn,<br />
<i>Abid</i> teg ar <i>y byd</i> hwn.<br />
Fal <i>tarth</i> uffern-<i>barth</i> ffwrn-bell;<br />
<i>Mwg</i> y <i>byd</i> yn <i>magu</i> o <i>bell</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second and last of these verses well show the use of what
is called the &ldquo;cynghanedd&rdquo; or consonancy of echoing
syllables required in the cywydd metre.&nbsp; Borrow, in getting
his own rhyme, rather loses the force of the original.&nbsp; For
instance, he omits the &ldquo;awyr ddu-lwyd&rdquo; in verse
three&mdash;the air black-grey&mdash;and he spoils in expanding
the idea of the verse&mdash;&ldquo;carthen anniben,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; Here the Welsh poet suggests that the mist is an
endless cloth, <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>woven perpetually in space.&nbsp; The packed lines of
the cywydd, and the concreteness of the imagery, set the
translator, however, a hard task.&nbsp; Borrow, in the
&ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; version, omits the opening of the poem,
whose last lines lead up to the apostrophe; but the MS. has
enabled Mr. Wise to complete it in his Bibliography.&nbsp; More
literally, the Welsh might be rendered thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Before I had gone a step of the way,<br />
I no longer saw a place in the land:<br />
Neither birchclad cliff, nor coast;<br />
Neither hill&rsquo;s-breast, mountain-side, nor sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it is he turns in his humorous rage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Och! confound thee, great yellow thing,<br
/>
That neither turns lighter, nor clears a bit;<br />
Black-grey chasuble of the air;<br />
An endless woven clout, thou art!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s difficulty in attacking the Welsh of a poet so
rapid and easy and light-footed, was that of a Zeppelin in
pursuit of a Farman.&nbsp; He was over-weighted from the
start.&nbsp; His early awkwardness in verse, his rhetoric learnt
from the artificial style of the generation before him, were in
his <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>way.&nbsp; Iolo Goch was much nearer to him, with the
admiring inventory of a chieftain&rsquo;s house, than was the art
of the poet of the leaves, the birch-grove and the
love-tryst.</p>
<p>But as time went on Borrow returned on his old steps, and he
took up some of his former handiwork, and smoothed away some of
its crudities.&nbsp; Mr. Wise, indeed, maintains that the Borrow
of 1826 was a much less finished verseman than the Borrow of
1854&ndash;60; and his Bibliography illustrates some of the
changes made for the better in Borrow&rsquo;s verse.&nbsp; Thus,
in one Norse ballad, he changes &ldquo;gore&rdquo; into
&ldquo;blood,&rdquo; and we remark in many lines an attempt to
get at a more natural style in verse.&nbsp; The account of
&ldquo;The Sleeping Bard&rdquo; in the Bibliography, shows that
the improvement in Borrow&rsquo;s craftsmanship went on after
1860, in which year the book was printed at Yarmouth (a very
limited edition, 250 copies at 5<i>s.</i> a copy).&nbsp; For
instance, in the poem, &ldquo;Death the Great,&rdquo; the seventh
stanza ran originally:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The song and dance afford, I
<i>ween</i>,<br />
Relief from <i>spleen</i>, and sorrow&rsquo;s grave;<br />
How very strange there is no <i>dance</i><br />
Nor tune of <i>France</i>, from Death can save.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>In 1871
the four lines were recast as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The song and dance can drive, they
<i>say</i>,<br />
The spleen <i>away</i>, and humour&rsquo;s grave;<br />
Why hast thou not devised, O <i>France</i><br />
Some tune and <i>dance</i> from Death to save?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again, we see, he purges his poetic diction, and turns
&ldquo;I ween&rdquo; into &ldquo;they say.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
remarkable that in translating these lines by Elis Wynn he is not
content to get the end-rhymes only, but accepts to the full the
difficulty of following the Welsh in the interned rhymes
throughout&mdash;as shown by the words italicised.</p>
<p>In his interesting account of &ldquo;George Borrow and his
Circle,&rdquo; Mr. Shorter quotes a letter from Professor Cowell
to a Norwich correspondent, Mr. James Hooper, which betrays some
disappointment over Borrow&rsquo;s Welsh interest at the close of
his life.&nbsp; Cowell had been inspired by &ldquo;Wild
Wales&rdquo; to learn Welsh, and even nursed a wish to do so
under Borrow himself.&nbsp; He found his way to Oulton Hall one
autumn day, and its master&mdash;now an old man close on
eighty&mdash;opened the door in person.&nbsp; The ardent visitor
talked to him of Ab Gwilym, but his interest was languid; and
even the news that the Honourable Cymmrodorion <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>were about to
publish the poems of Iolo Goch did not rouse him.&nbsp; Cowell
himself, it may be added, afterwards wrote an excellent
appreciation of Ab Gwilym in the Transactions of the same
society.&nbsp; In his letter, Cowell speaks of Borrow&rsquo;s
carelessness as a translator, and declares the very
title&mdash;&ldquo;Visions of the Sleeping Bard&rdquo;&mdash;to
be wrong; it should be, not the &ldquo;Sleeping Bard,&rdquo; but
the &ldquo;Bard Sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, in this case,
Borrow&rsquo;s instinct was truer than his critic&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
For &ldquo;Cwsg&rdquo; is used as a noun-adjective by Elis Wynn;
and the latest translator of the book&mdash;Mr. Gwyneddon Davies
<a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a>&mdash;adopts the same title
precisely.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s record as a Welsh translator would not be
complete without a page or so of his version of the prose text of
the same work.&nbsp; Elis Wynn, I may explain, was, after the
tale-writers of the Mabinogion, the best author of Welsh
narrative prose that the language possesses.&nbsp; He was at once
idiomatic and exact in style.&nbsp; He knew how to get the golden
epithet; his diction was bold and biblical, his vocabulary could
be at times startling and Rabelaisean.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>efficiency in
rendering him may be tested by a couple of passages.&nbsp; The
first takes us to the City of Destruction and its
streets:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are those streets
called,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Each is called,&rsquo; he
replied, &lsquo;by the name of the princess who governs it: the
first is the street of Pride, the middle one the street of
Pleasure, and the nearest, the street of Lucre.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pray, tell me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;who are dwelling in
these streets?&nbsp; What is the language which they speak?&nbsp;
What are the tenets which they hold?&nbsp; To what nation do they
belong?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Many,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;of every
language, faith and nation under the sun are living in each of
those vast streets below; and there are many in each of the three
streets alternately, and everyone as near as possible to the
gate; and they frequently remove, unable to tarry long in the
one, from the great love they bear to the princess of some other
street; and the old fox looks slyly on, permitting everyone to
love his choice, or all three if he pleases, for then he is most
sure of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come nearer to them,&rsquo; said the angel, and
hurried with me downwards, shrouded in his impenetrable veil,
through much noxious vapour which was rising from the city;
presently, we descended in the street <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of Pride, upon a spacious mansion
open at the top, whose windows had been dashed out by dogs and
crows, and whose owners had departed to England or France, to
seek there for what they could have obtained much easier at home;
thus, instead of the good, old, charitable, domestic family of
yore, there were none at present but owls, crows, or chequered
magpies, whose hooting, cawing, and chattering were excellent
comments on the practices of the present owners.&nbsp; There were
in that street myriads of such abandoned palaces, which might
have been, had it not been for Pride, the resorts of the best, as
of yore, places of refuge for the weak, schools of peace and of
every kind of goodness; and blessings to thousands of small
houses around.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This comes from the first of the Three Dreams, that of the
World; and a further quotation from the same dream-book touches
what is Borrow&rsquo;s high-water mark as a
translator:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thereupon we turned our faces from the
great city of Perdition, and went up to the other little
city.&nbsp; In going along, I could see at the upper end of the
streets many turning half-way from the temptations of the gates
of Perdition and seeking for the <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>gate of Life; but whether it was that
they failed to find it, or grew tired upon the way, I could not
see that any went through, except one sorrowful faced man, who
ran forward resolutely, while thousands on each side of him were
calling him fool, some scoffing him, others threatening him, and
his friends laying hold upon him, and entreating him not to take
a step by which he would lose the whole world at once.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I only lose,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;a very small portion
of it, and if I should lose the whole, pray what loss is
it?&nbsp; For what is there in the world so desirable, unless a
man should desire deceit, and violence, and misery, and
wretchedness, giddiness and distraction?&nbsp; Contentment and
tranquillity,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;constitute the happiness of
man; but in your city there are no such things to be found.&nbsp;
Because who is there here content with his station?&nbsp; Higher,
higher! is what everyone endeavours to be in the street of
Pride.&nbsp; Give, give us a little more, says everyone in the
street of Lucre.&nbsp; Sweet, sweet, pray give me some more of
it, is the cry of everyone in the street of Pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And as for tranquillity, where is it? and who
obtains it?&nbsp; If you be a great man, flattery and envy are
killing you.&nbsp; <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>If you be poor, everyone is trampling upon and despising
you.&nbsp; After having become an inventor, if you exalt your
head and seek for praise, you will be called a boaster and a
coxcomb.&nbsp; If you lead a godly life and resort to the Church
and the altar, you will be called a hypocrite.&nbsp; If you do
not, then you are an infidel or a heretic.&nbsp; If you be merry,
you will be called a buffoon.&nbsp; If you are silent, you will
be called a morose wretch.&nbsp; If you follow honesty, you are
nothing but a simple fool.&nbsp; If you go neat, you are proud;
if not, a swine.&nbsp; If you are smooth speaking, then you are
false, or a trifler without meaning.&nbsp; If you are rough, you
are an arrogant, disagreeable devil.&nbsp; Behold the world that
you magnify!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;pray take my share of
it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the foregoing extract Borrow makes a few obvious
errors.&nbsp; For instance, he turns the Welsh word
&ldquo;dyfeiswr&rdquo; into &ldquo;inventor,&rdquo; whereas the
sense here implies a schemer, or intriguer (the last is the
rendering adopted by Mr. Gwyneddon Davies), and the translation
suffers a corresponding lapse in the same clause.&nbsp; But on
the whole Borrow&rsquo;s rendering is good of its kind, and it
gains by its freedom at times, as in the page where he turns
&ldquo;dwylla <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>o&rsquo;th arian a&rsquo;th hoedl hefyd,&rdquo; into
&ldquo;chouses you of your money and your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact is, Borrow was vital in prose, while the shackles of
verse often weighed on him.&nbsp; It was only in mid-career that
he learnt to move at all easily in them&mdash;how much more
easily we should not have known had not Mr. Wise, with his
bibliographical intrepidity, set about printing for his own
library some of the unpublished matter.&nbsp; In the light of
those green quartos, Borrow is seen to be a translator of more
force than grace, who generally contrived to give a flavour of
his own to whatever he touched.&nbsp; Because of the subtleties
of the prosody, he was rather less effective in dealing with
Welsh and Celtic than with Norse and Gothic verse.&nbsp; But he
managed to create an English that was undoubtedly rare in his
day, and is now unique because the Borrovian accent is in it, and
the masculine voice of Borrow&mdash;like the cry of Vidrik in the
ballad&mdash;is unmistakable.&nbsp; He knew the art of giving a
name to things; and, again like Vidrik, who called his sword
&ldquo;mimmering,&rdquo; and his shield &ldquo;skrepping,&rdquo;
this Cornish East Anglian, who dabbled in gipsy lore and learnt
Welsh, made his weapons part of himself, whether <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>they
consisted of his pen, his portentous umbrella, or his
father&rsquo;s silver-handled blade:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;st decked old chiefs of
Cornwall&rsquo;s land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To face the fiend with thee they dared;<br />
Thou prov&rsquo;dst a Tirfing in their hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which victory gave whene&rsquo;er &rsquo;twas
bared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though Cornwall&rsquo;s moors &rsquo;twas ne&rsquo;er
my lot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To view, in Eastern Anglia born,<br />
Yet I her sons&rsquo; rude strength have got,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And feel of death their fearless scorn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Little need be added about the various sources of the
following text.&nbsp; The first three poems are from a quarto MS.
owned by Mr. Gurney of Norwich, who has kindly lent it to the
publishers.&nbsp; Its title runs:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>poems</i>.<br />
By IOLO GOCH;<br />
With a Metrical English Translation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some former owner has pencilled below, &ldquo;By Mr. Borrer of
Norwich&rdquo; (<i>sic</i>).&nbsp; From Mr. Wise&rsquo;s green
quartos, already referred to, or from MSS. in his library, come
the two Goronwy Owen poems, &ldquo;The Pedigree of the
Muse,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Harp.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also Lewis
Morris the Elder&rsquo;s lines, &ldquo;The Cuckoo&rsquo;s Song in
Meirion,&rdquo; or Merion, according to Borrow.&nbsp; The
Epigrams by <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Carolan and &ldquo;Song of Deirdra&rdquo; are Irish
items from the same source; while &ldquo;Pwll Cheres, the Vortex
of Menai,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Mountain Snow,&rdquo; are two
Welsh ones, which have not, I believe, been printed in any other
form.&nbsp; The familiar pages of &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; and
the less-known volume, &ldquo;Targum,&rdquo; account for the bulk
of the remaining poems and fragments; while Borrow&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Quarterly Review&rdquo; article on Welsh Poetry (January,
1861) provides us with four more translations.&nbsp; The versions
are printed with all their faults on their head; and if he put a
whiting into a fresh-water fish-pond (in the Ode on Sycharth,
original text), or mistook a saint for a secular detail, the
collector of his works will be glad to have the plain evidence
under his hand, and will not wonder a bit the less at the boyish
achievement of this East-country Celt.&nbsp; It remains to be
said that, being Borrow, he was duly astonished at himself, and
under the Sycharth poem wrote in Welsh a footnote which runs in
effect: &ldquo;The English translation is the work of George
Borrow, an English lad of the City of Norwich, who has never been
in Wales, and has never in all his life heard a word of Welsh
from man or woman.&rdquo;</p>

Wales, and flourished about the end of the fourteenth and
commencement of the fifteenth century.&nbsp; He was the
contemporary of the celebrated Owain Glendower, and one of the

his songs he kindled the spirit of his countrymen against the
English, and by his praises of Glendower increased their
pre-existing enthusiasm for that chieftain.&nbsp; The present
poem was composed some years previous to the insurrection of
Glendower against Henry the Fourth, and describes with the utmost

the period when Glendower had nearly attained the summit of his
greatness; the insurrection which he commenced in September,
1400, by sacking and burning the town of Ruthin, having hitherto
sustained no check whatever.&nbsp; In the present poem his bard
hails the appearance of the Comet as a divine prognostic of the

fought many unsuccessful battles, in which all his sons perished,
bravely maintaining the cause of their father.&nbsp; His
adherents being either slaughtered or dispirited, the Welsh
Chieftain retired into concealment&mdash;but where, no mortal at
the present day can assert with certainty, but it is believed
that he died of grief and disappointment in the year 1415, at the
house of his daughter, the wife of Sir John Scudamore, of
Monington in Herefordshire.&nbsp; The fall of Glendower was a
bitter mortification to the Bards, whom he had so long feasted in
the watery valley <a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a> from which he derived his surname; many
poetical compositions are still preserved, written with the view
of reviving the hopes of his dispirited friends.&nbsp; Amongst
these the following by Iolo <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Goch is perhaps the most
remarkable.&nbsp; He hints that the Chieftain has repaired to
Rome, from which he will return with a warrant under the seal of
the Pope, to take possession of his right.&nbsp; Then he flings
out a surmise that he has travelled to the Holy Sepulchre, and
will re-appear, with a Danish and Irish fleet to back his
cause.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the little regard paid to truth and
probability in this piece, and notwithstanding its strange
metaphors and obscure allusions, it displays marks of no ordinary
poetic talent, and is a convincing proof that the fire and genius
of the author had not deserted him at fourscore, to which
advanced age he had attained when he wrote it.</p>

infancy lying in a coracle, on a salmon-weir, in the domain of
Elphin, a prince of North Wales, who became his patron.&nbsp;
During his life he arrogated to himself a supernatural descent
and understanding, and for at least a thousand years after his
death he was regarded by the descendants of the ancient Britons
in the character of a prophet or something more.&nbsp; The poems
which he produced procured for him the title of &ldquo;Bardic
King;&rdquo; they display much that is vigorous and original, but
are disfigured by mysticism and extravagant metaphor; one of the
most spirited of them is the following, which the author calls
his &ldquo;Hanes&rdquo; or history.</p>

When ended was the work sublime<br />
They rose to sing a second time.<br />
Thousands of heaven&rsquo;s brightest powers<br />

The arch of heaven shook and reel&rsquo;d.<br />
Down from the heaven&rsquo;s lofty blue<br />
To this low world the accents flew,<br />
In Paradise&rsquo;s blissful bound.<br />
Our Father Adam heard the sound;<br />
Delighted man&rsquo;s first father hears<br />
The praise and music of the spheres;<br />
To imitate the strain he tries,<br />
And soon succeeds in gallant guise.<br />
Delighted was his Eva dear<br />

A hundred sang, and with renown,<br />
Ere we arrive at David down;<br />

For music and for minstrelsy.</p>
<p class="poetry">A Muse, and wondrous sweet its tone,<br />

To us his lowly children here.</p>
<p class="poetry">In halls of heaven so bright and sheen<br />
The power of song is great, I ween;<br />

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
